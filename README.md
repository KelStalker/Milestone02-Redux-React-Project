## MOVIE BLOG APP    


This app has been built by using Redux, React, React-Router & typescript, Formik libraries as our milestone 02 project. The proposed aim of this app is to demonstrate; 
1.	Semantic UI React 
2.	Use of redux to mange the states 
3.	Ability to get user input and process data before the output 
4.	Use of props, lifecycle methods
5.	 Use of React Router to display multiple pages 

Following commands can be used to run this project 

-	npx create-react-app router-redux --typescript
- npm install --save redux @types/redux
- npm install --save react-redux @types/react-redux
- npm install --save react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
-	npm install semantic-ui-react
-	npm install react-calendar
-	npm I formic


## USER MANUAL 
By default, the user will find a active nav bar with Movie List abut us and login buttons with a home page. The User can login by correct user name and password. On successful login, user will be directed to the Movie Dropdown list and where he/she can select from list of selected movies and on choosing a movie from the list, the user will be directed to another page where certain predefined details of that movie can be seen (under construction). On the same page there is a functional movie blog section where the user can give his/her feed back about the movie and also can give ratings. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
